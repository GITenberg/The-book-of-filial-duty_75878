very definite one. They desire above all
things that, in their humble way, these books
shall be the ambassadors of goodwill and
understanding between East and West—the old
world of Thought and the new of Action. In
this endeavour, and in their own sphere, they
are but followers of the highest example in the
land. They are confident that a deeper knowledge
of the great ideals and lofty philosophy
of Oriental thought may help to a revival of
that true spirit of Charity which neither despises
nor fears the nations of another creed and
colour. Finally, in thanking press and public
for the very cordial reception given to the
“Wisdom of the East” Series, they wish to state
that no pains have been spared to secure the
best specialists for the treatment of the various
subjects at hand.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The Origin of the Book</span></h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> <cite>Hsiao Ching</cite>, or <cite>Book of Filial Duty</cite>, is
generally held to be the work of an unknown
pupil of Tsêng Ts‘an, the disciple of
Confucius, to whom is attributed the famous
Confucian classic known as <cite>The Greater Learning</cite>.
Certainly it can be traced back as far as 400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
within a century from the death of Confucius.
The preservation of the text in its present form
is due to the Emperor Ming Huang (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 685-762),
one of the most fascinating characters in
Chinese history, who had it engraved, together
with eleven other of the Confucian writings, on
tablets of stone and set up in his capital of
Chang-an. He afterwards added a commentary
of his own, which is still extant, and has proved
invaluable to all commentators of a later period.
<cite>The Book of Filial Duty</cite> is often found in China
bound up with another treatise called the <cite>Hsiao
Hsüeh</cite>, or <cite>Teaching for the Young</cite>, of which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
following is a specimen: “The way to become
a student is with meekness and humility, receiving
with confidence every word spoken by
the master. The pupil, when he sees men of
virtue, should try to follow in their steps; when
he hears wise sayings, he should try to conform
to them. He must not harbour evil designs,
but always act honourably. Whether at home
or abroad, he must have a fixed abode, and resort
with those who are well disposed, regulating his
demeanour with care, and curbing the passions.”</p>

<p>Few books have enjoyed greater popularity
amongst all classes in China than <cite>The Book of
Filial Duty</cite>. It may be called <cite>The Book of Emperors</cite>,
from the fact that so many Emperors,
both before and after Ming Huang, have commentated
upon it. Equally it is <cite>The Book of
Youth</cite>, being the first treatise of importance
placed in the hands of children, after the horn
books of elementary instruction. The reason
for its survival after so many centuries is not
hard to seek. Family life has always been, from
time immemorial, the foundation-stone of the
Chinese Empire, and filial piety is the foundation-stone
of family life. Nor does this duty of son
to father merely extend to the living. The
living head of the family pays due reverence to
the countless ancestors who have preceded him.
A witty Chinese writer once remarked that in
the West family life only began after death—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the family vault. Here, at any rate, after
years of separation and divided interests, the
members met to enjoy a common oblivion. I
cannot but think that there is some exaggeration
in this; yet not even the greatest apologist of
Western methods will venture to deny that the
Chinese and indeed most Oriental ideals of family
life are superior to his own. Whilst living, only
the calls of Empire, or the demands of their
profession, may keep relations apart; but the
interests of the family are always greater than
the interests of the individual, and no exile is
without hope of return to the home of his fathers.
The dead will not be forgotten, for it will be the
duty of their sons to offer sacrifice to their shades.
The death-days of two generations of parents
are kept sacred with solemn festival, and the
nameless and unnumbered dead have their
special days of ceremony and remembrance in
the spring and autumn. Every house has its
family shrine, every village its hall of ancestors.
Thus the filial piety of the survivors honours
those who have gone.</p>

<p>As regards the living, respect is the great
essential of daily intercourse. The subject respects
his emperor, the son his father, the
wife her husband, and the younger brother his
elder brother. But respect is not only for those
older than ourselves, or of superior station. The
wisdom of Confucius is nowhere more clearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
shown than in his utterance concerning the
respect to be paid to youth: “A youth is to be
regarded with respect. How do we know that
his future will not be equal to our present? If
he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not
made himself heard of, then he will indeed not
be worthy of respect.”</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maxima debetur pueris reverentia!</i></p>

<p>The Chinese national spirit is a spirit of continuity;
the spirit of the Confucian philosophy
is a spirit of harmony with the environment of
daily life. “Confucius,” says Tzŭ-ssŭ, “possessed,
as if by hereditary transmission, the virtues
of Yao and Shun [Emperors of the Golden Age],
and modelled himself on Wên and Wu [first King
of the Chou dynasty, 1133 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>] as his exemplars.
Above all, he kept in unison with the seasons of
the sky; below, he conformed to the water and
the land.</p>

<p>“We may liken him unto the sky and earth in
respect of the universality with which they
uphold and sustain things, the universality with
which they overspread and enfold things. We
may liken him unto the four seasons in respect
of their varied march; unto the sun and moon
in respect of their alternate shining.</p>

<p>“All things are kept in train together without
their injuring one another; their ways go on
together without interfering one with another:
the smaller forces in river streams, the greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
forces in ample transformations. It is this that
makes the sky and earth so great.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The first environment of the human soul is
that of the family. Before we can become good
subjects, before we can aspire to study nature
and mould ourselves upon the laws of heaven
and earth, we must first of all learn to become
good sons, to complete the unity of family life.
All things will be added in their due course. To
the Chinese mind the successful policy in life is
a policy of adjustment. This policy runs from
highest to lowest, and back again from lowest
to highest. The Emperor adjusts himself to the
requirements of his great Ministers, they in
their turn to the provincial governors, they in
their turn to the local magistrates, and so on
down the scale of social order. So this policy of
adjustment works equally upwards from the
youngest son of the meanest family to the Emperor
himself, who adjusts his methods to those
employed by his August Father. As <cite>The Book
of Odes</cite> says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">That great and noble Prince displayed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sense of right in all he wrought;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Adjusting justly, grade by grade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The spirit of his wisdom swayed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Peasant and peer; the crowd, the court.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is for this reason that <cite>The Book of Filial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Duty</cite> commences with a chapter on “Filial Piety
in the Son of Heaven.” The Emperor is, the
Emperor always has been, the father of the
greatest family on earth—the Chinese nation.</p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Twenty-four Examples of Filial Duty</span></h3>

<p>Instead of the <cite>Hsiao Hsüeh</cite>, or <cite>Teaching for the
Young</cite>, which is usually grouped with <cite>The Book
of Filial Duty</cite>, I have chosen <cite>The Twenty-four
Examples of Filial Duty</cite> by way of illustration
to the <cite>Hsiao Ching</cite>. They are naïve and terse,
and yet not without their simple charm. Even
where they lend themselves to exaggeration, as
in the story of the old gentleman who dressed
himself in gay garments and frisked in front of
his very venerable parents, they are not meaningless
nor devoid of humanity. The lesson to
be drawn is that our duty towards our parents
is the first obligation in life, and that we should
go, if necessary, to all lengths to fulfil it. Nothing
is known of the authorship of these stories, or
the time in which they are written. Each story
is accompanied by its commentary, and probably
the stories themselves originated during the Ming
dynasty (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1368-1644), the commentaries belonging
mostly to the latter years of that dynasty.
The period dealt with in these tales is a very
wide one, and ranges from the time of the great
Emperor Shun (<em>circa</em> 2300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) down to the Sung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
dynasty (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 900-1200). There have been many
editions of <cite>The Twenty-four Examples</cite> in Chinese,
mostly embellished with quaint and original
woodcuts, of which the figure on the cover of
the present volume, kindly supplied by Mrs.
Lionel Giles, is an example.</p>


<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Filial Duty and Parental Love</span></h3>

<p>In conclusion, I hope none of my readers will
imagine, from these examples and the treatise
that precedes them, that Chinese family life is
cold and repellent, and devoid of mutual love.
The moment a tiny life enters the circle it is
guarded by the triple walls of kinship. In the
children our parents return to us; in the children
we survive. All through Chinese history the
exile longs for return to wife and children. All
through Chinese literature you will find allusion
to the love of little ones which has been the
heritage of the Chinese from time unknown.
<cite>The Book of Odes</cite>, quoted in Mr. Ku Hung-ming’s
eloquent translation of the <cite>Chung Yung</cite>, or
<cite>Conduct of Life</cite>, for this Series, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When wives and children and their sires are one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis like the harp and lute in unison.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When brothers live in concord and in peace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The strains of harmony shall never cease.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lamp of happy union lights the home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>And bright days follow when the children come</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>
<p>With the Chinese the natural joys of life have
always been the most sought after. Home,
family, friendship, landscape, and flowers—these
are the pleasures which they delight in. The
religion of Confucius is the religion of daily life.
On the side of the parent there is responsibility;
on the side of the child, obedience, but not a
blind one. Of the responsibility of parents there
is no question. Confucius himself laid down the
law when he sentenced a father, who had brought
an accusation against his son, to be imprisoned
with him. On being remonstrated with, he made
this memorable reply: “Am I to punish for a
breach of filial piety one who has never been
taught to be filially minded? Is not he who
neglects to teach his son his duties equally guilty
with the son who fails in them? Crime is not
inherent in human nature, and therefore the father
in the family and the government in the State
are responsible for the crimes committed against
filial piety and the public laws.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the obedient son must be
able to discriminate and not follow blindly, when
the father is at fault. In the <cite>Li Chi</cite>, or <cite>Book of
Rites</cite>, it is written: “When his parents are in
error, the son must remonstrate with them with
respect and gently. If they do not receive his reproof,
he must strive more and more to be dutiful
and respectful towards them till they are pleased,
and then he must again point out their fault.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>The Chinese give respect to the living, and also
reverence the dead. It is from the past that
they have tried to learn, and the past is a pathway
which the feet of spirits have trodden and made
luminous. And, moreover, no man can escape
from his ancestors, even if he go to the uttermost
parts of the earth and dwell among strangers.
Over the heads of the family the politician, ancient
and modern, looks to the State. But China, from
the shelter and security of her myriad bulwarks,
has watched the sun of many empires rise and
set.</p>

<h2>THE DOCTRINE OF FILIAL DUTY</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<h4>THE MEANING OF FILIAL DUTY</h4>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Once</span> upon a time Confucius was sitting in
his study, having his disciple Tsêng Ts‘an to
attend upon him. He asked Tsêng Ts‘an: “Do
you know by what virtue and power the good Emperors
of old made the world peaceful, the people
to live in harmony with one another, and the
inferior contented under the control of their
superiors?” To this Tsêng Ts‘an, rising from
his seat, replied: “I do not know this, for I am
not clever.” Then said Confucius: “The duty
of children to their parents is the fountain whence
all other virtues spring, and also the starting-point
from which we ought to begin our education.
Now take your seat, and I will explain this. Our
body and hair and skin are all derived from our
parents, and therefore we have no right to injure
any of them in the least. This is the first duty
of a child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“To live an upright life and to spread the
great doctrines of humanity must win good
reputation after death, and reflect great honour
upon our parents. This is the last duty of a son.</p>

<p>“Hence the first duty of a son is to pay a
careful attention to every want of his parents.
The next is to serve his government loyally;
and the last to establish a good name for himself.</p>

<p>“So it is written in the <cite>Ta Ya</cite><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>: ‘You must
think of your ancestors and continue to cultivate
the virtue which you inherit from them.’”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h3>
</div>

<h4>THE FILIAL DUTY OF AN EMPEROR</h4>

<p class="no-indent">In order to prevent the people from treating their
parents with cruelty, the Emperor first sets an
example to them by showing a dear love to his
mother; and in order to teach them not to treat
their parents with rudeness, he first treats his
parents with respect. Having loved and respected
his own parents, his good conduct will influence
the minds of his people, and his good example
will be followed by them.</p>

<p>So it is written in the <cite>Fu Hsing</cite><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>: “When
the Emperor has done a good act, millions
will be benefited.”</p>

a haughty manner; and will be ever able to keep
his wealth if he is frugal and careful in his expenses.</p>

<p>When he is able to secure himself in his high
position, he can, of course, remain unimpaired
in his dignity; and where he can keep his wealth,
he will always remain rich. Having placed
himself in a position of honour, and secured the
possession of his wealth, he will be able to protect
his country and further the welfare of his people.
This is the filial duty of a feudal Prince.</p>

not behave ourselves in such a way as they

what we say and what we do. If so, then nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
will be able to find fault with our words or with
our deeds, and therefore we shall be able to keep
our family from being visited with any serious
misfortune, and to offer sacrifices to our ancestors
for ever. This is the filial duty of a high officer.</p>

love toward them is the same. From the manner
in which we should treat our father we also
learn how to serve our August Master. The
respect shown to them is the same. To our
mother we show love, to our August Master
respect, while to our father, both love and respect.
If we can serve our August Master with such
feelings as we have toward our father, then
loyalty is shown; and if we treat venerable
persons with respect, then harmony will reign in
the circle of our life. Not failing to treat the
August Master with loyalty and the venerable
with respect, we shall be able to make ourselves
secure in our high position and to offer sacrifices

<h4>THE “THREE POWERS”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h4>

<p class="no-indent">On hearing what Confucius said about filial
duty, Tsêng Tzŭ remarked: “How great is the
use of filial duty!” Here Confucius continued:
“Filial duty is the constant doctrine of Heaven,
the natural righteousness of Earth, and the
practical duty of man. Every member of the
community ought to observe it with the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
care. We do what is dictated by Heaven and
what is good for the general public in order to
organise the community. On this account our
education is widespread, though it is not compulsory,
and our government is sound, though
it is not rigorous. The effect of education upon
the minds of the people was well known to the
good Emperors of old. They made every person
love his parents by loving their own parents first.
They induced every person to cultivate his virtue
by expounding the advantages of virtue to him.
They behaved themselves respectfully and humbly,
so that the people might not quarrel with one
another. They trained the people with ceremonial
observances, and educated them with
music so that they might live in harmony. They
told the people what things they liked or disliked
to see done, so that they might understand what
they were forbidden to do.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Shih Ching</cite> it is thus written: “The
dignified statesman is always the subject of the
attention of the people.”</p>

<h4>FILIAL DUTY IN GOVERNMENT</h4>

<p class="no-indent">The good Emperors of old ruled the Empire by
means of filial duty, and dared not neglect the
ministers of their vassal states. How much less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
the dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons!
They thereby gained the goodwill of all their vassal
states, which sent their deputies to represent
them in any sacrifice offered to the ancestors of
their Supreme Master. This is what we mean
by saying that the good Emperors of old governed
the world by filial duty.</p>

<p>As to the vassal states, their rulers dared not
treat widowers and widows with insolence; how
then could they dare act so towards the literary
class and the people? Hence they gained the
goodwill of their subjects, and the latter would
join them in offering sacrifices to their ancestors.</p>

<p>Now we may say a word about a family. If
the head of a family do not act haughtily towards
his servant, he cannot act so to his wife and
children. Hence he will gain the goodwill of all
his people, and they will help him in the fulfilment
of his filial duty. In such a family the parents
must feel happy when they are living, and their
spirits must come to enjoy the sacrifice when
they are dead. By the principle of filial duty
the whole world can be made happy and all
calamities and dangers can be averted. Such
was the government of the Empire by the enlightened
rulers of old, in accordance with the
principle of filial duty.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Shih Ching</cite> it is thus written: “If you
adorn yourself with the highest virtue, the whole
world will follow you.”</p>

<h4>GOVERNMENT BY THE SAGE</h4>

<p class="no-indent">Tsêng Tzŭ asked: “Is filial piety the highest of
all the virtues possessed by a great sage?” To
this Confucius replied: “There is nothing so great
in the world as man, and there is nothing so great
in a man as filial piety. The first duty of a son
is to venerate his parent, and in order to show
reverence for his dead father he has to offer him
sacrifice when he offers sacrifices to Heaven. A
man who had done this was the Duke of Chou.
When he offered sacrifices to Heaven in a suburban
district, he also offered a sacrifice to his deceased
ancestor Hou Chi, and when he offered sacrifice
to Heaven at the temple named Ming Tang, he
also made one to his deceased father Wên Wang.
His good action produced such an effect that all
the feudal barons at that time came to assist him
in performing the ceremony of offering sacrifice
to Heaven. It is therefore evident that there is
nothing so great in human nature as filial piety.
The feeling of affection is fostered during the
time of infancy, and from that affection springs
reverence. Since every man has a natural
reverence, the great sages of the time teach him
how and when to show it; and since he has a
natural feeling of affection, they teach him when
and how to cultivate it. As the teachings of
these sages are based on the principle of filial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
piety, their doctrine is propagated without effort,
and their government is effectual without resorting
to force. The affection between a father and a
son is natural, and also a source from which
springs the reverence which a minister ought to
show to his sovereign. When parents have a son
born to them, the regular line of descent in the
family is thereby secured. This is the greatest
duty in family life. We must treat our parents
with the same reverence as is shown to our
sovereign, because we receive boundless kindness
from them and are under a natural obligation to
do so. If any one does not love his parents, but
others, he is a rebel against virtue; and if any one
does not respect his parents, but others, he is also
a rebel against the standard of rites. Any action
which is against the law of nature will certainly
not be an example for the public; and any one
who gets a high position, such as that of a ruler,
by undue influence instead of by good actions,
will be despised by good men. As to the latter,
they say what they ought to say, and do what
they think is good for the public. Their virtue
and justice are estimable, their actions are worthy
of being followed, their behaviour is creditable,
and their manner is correct in every way. If
such persons are rulers of a state, they will afford
to the people a good example to follow and will
also inspire them with reverence and affection.
This is principally the cause of their being successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
in propagating their doctrines, and in
effectually carrying on their government. Do you
not remember what is said in the <cite>Shih Ching</cite>?—‘Look
at that good man. How correct his
behaviour is!’”</p>

<h4>THE FILIAL DUTY OF A SON</h4>

<p class="no-indent">Confucius said: “A filial son has five duties to
perform to his parents: (1) He must venerate
them in daily life. (2) He must try to make
them happy in every possible way, especially
when the meal is served. (3) He must take extra
care of them when they are sick. (4) He ought
to show great sorrow for them when they are
dead. (5) He must offer sacrifices to his deceased
parents with the utmost solemnity. If he fulfils
these duties, then he can be considered as having
done what ought to be done by a son.”</p>

<p>A son ought not to feel proud of the high
position he occupies, ought not to show dissatisfaction
with his inferior position to that of others,
and ought not to act against the natural feeling of
the public. If he is proud and haughty when he
is a high official, he will soon bring ruin upon
himself and his family; if he feels dissatisfied
with his lower position, he may be led to do
illegal acts; and if he does anything contrary
to the public feeling, he will probably be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
object of attacks. Having thus wronged himself,
he cannot be considered as a filial son, although
he treats his parents every day to luxurious meals.</p>

<h4>THE FIVE PUNISHMENTS</h4>

<p class="no-indent">The criminal law consists principally of five
punishments, which are directed against three
thousand offences. Of them, disobedience to
one’s parents is considered the most heinous
crime.</p>

<p>To threaten the sovereign with force is an
act which shows that the wrongdoer does not
know the duty of an inferior to a superior; to say
anything against the government founded by
the wise men of many generations gone by is an
act which shows that the speaker does not know
what law is; and to say that a son need not be
filial to his parents is also an act which shows
that the speaker does not know what is the natural
relation and duty between a son and parents.
Such acts will no doubt lead the man to a wrong
course of life.</p>

<h4>AMPLIFICATION OF THE “IMPORTANT DOCTRINE”</h4>

<p class="no-indent">Confucius said: “The best way to teach the
people to love their sovereign is for the sovereign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
first to love his own parents; to teach them to
be polite to each other is for the sovereign himself
first to be polite to all his elders; and to improve
bad manners and customs is for him first to pay
attention to the composition of the music played
in the country.</p>

<p>“What is etiquette? It is simply due respect
to one’s elders. If I respect the parents, the son
will be pleased; if I respect the elder brothers,
the younger ones will be pleased; and if I respect
the sovereign, all the ministers will be pleased.
I respect only one person, but I please thousands
upon thousands. Those to whom the respect is
paid are few, and those whom I please are many.
This is what is called an ‘important doctrine.’”</p>

<h4>AMPLIFICATION OF “THE HIGHEST VIRTUE”</h4>

teaches them by his showing reverence to all old
people. In the same manner he teaches his
people to show respect to their elders by doing
so first; and to be loyal to their ruler by his
doing duty to his superiors first.</p>

<p>“The <cite>Shih Ching</cite> says, ‘The behaviour of the
ruler is so good that he is loved by the people as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
their parent.’ A ruler could not have been so
loved by his people had he not possessed the

August Master with patriotism. He always shows
reverence to his elder brothers, and in order to
fulfil his duty to them to the fullest extent, he
does the same towards every one who is older
than he.</p>

<p>“As he can maintain order in his family affairs,
so he can do the same in the government. He
bases the principle of the government of a State
upon that of a ruling family, and the consequent
success will make his name to be remembered
throughout generations to come.”</p>

<h4>THE QUESTION OF REMONSTRANCE IN CONNECTION
WITH FILIAL DUTY</h4>

<p class="no-indent">Tsêng Tzŭ said: “I have heard all that you
said about parental love, filial love, reverence to
elders, how to treat parents every day, and how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
to please them by making oneself known for good
conduct; and now I will venture to ask you
whether it is filial that a son should obey every
command of his father, whether right or wrong?”</p>

<p>“What do you say?—what do you say?”
replied Confucius. “Once upon a time there
was a certain Emperor who would have lost his
empire through his wickedness, but that he had
seven good ministers who often checked his illegal
actions by strong protests; there was also a
feudal baron who would have lost his feudal
estate through wantonness, but for the fact that
he had five good men who often made strong
remonstrances to him; and there was also a
statesman who would have brought frightful
calamity upon his family, but for the fact that
he had three good servants who often strongly
advised him not to do what he ought not.</p>

<p>“If a man has a good friend to resist him in
doing bad actions, he will have his reputation
preserved; so if a father has a son to resist his
wrong commands, he will be saved from committing
serious faults.</p>

<p>“When the command is wrong, a son should
resist his father, and a minister should resist his
August Master.</p>

<p>“The maxim is, ‘Resist when wrongly commanded.’
Hence how can he be called filial
who obeys his father when he is commanded to
do wrong?”</p>

<h4>THE INFLUENCE AND FRUIT OF FILIAL PIETY</h4>

<p class="no-indent">The good Emperors of old were not only filial to
their parents, but also to the Supreme Father and
Mother—that is, Heaven and the Earth. When
an Emperor can live in harmony with his elders,
there will be harmony throughout his dominion
between superiors and inferiors; and when he is
filial to the Supreme Father and Mother, he will
be blessed by them.</p>

<p>Although the Emperor is the highest of all ranks,
yet he still has some one to respect. He has his
father and elder brothers.</p>

<p>Why do we offer sacrifices to our ancestors in
our family shrine? Because we ought not to
forget them. Why must we cultivate our minds
and be circumspect in our actions? Because we
do not wish to bring disgrace upon the name of
our ancestors. If we can show respect to them
when we offer them sacrifices in our family shrine,
we shall be blessed by the Supreme Father and
Mother. Filiality to parents and reverence to
elders will be known to the Supreme Being, and
will be followed by the people in every part of
the world; no place can remain unaffected by
their influence. In the <cite>Shih Ching</cite> it is said that
“from east to west and from north to south
there is no one who does not submit to rule.”</p>

<h4>SERVING THE SOVEREIGN</h4>

<p class="no-indent">Confucius said: “A good man always endeavours,
while he is in the service of his sovereign,
to express the utmost loyalty during audience
with his August Master, and thinks at his leisure
how to repair any wrong his August Master may
have done. He will carry out any praiseworthy
schemes projected by his master, and will correct
any fault which he may commit. In this way
a great affection will be fostered between them.</p>

<p>“Thus in the <cite>Shih Ching</cite> it is written: ‘Although
the minister may be far away from his
master, yet his affection will not be affected by
the distance. He is so attached to him that he
thinks of him every day.’”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<h4>MOURNING FOR ONE’S PARENTS</h4>

<p class="no-indent">Confucius said: “When a filial son loses his
parent, he, of course, cannot help crying piteously.
He cannot feel happy when he hears music. He
will have no appetite for food, however tempting
a savoury. He will greet no visitor, have no
regard for elegance of speech, and will put on a
mourning-dress instead of a beautiful one. All
these tell us the extent of his sorrow for his lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
parent. What is meant by the saying that he
must try to eat something after three days from
the death of his parent, though he has no appetite
for it? It teaches us that although we have to
show great sorrow for the dead, yet we must not
sacrifice ourselves on their account, and that we
must not carry self-mortification so far as to
destroy our life. This is the doctrine laid down
by good men of old. That mourning only extends
to the period of three years shows that
there is a limit for our sorrow.</p>

<p>“For the corpse we make a coffin and some
clothes. We set forth the sacrificial vessels, and
at the sight of them grief breaks forth afresh.
The women beat their breasts, the men stamp
their feet, and with weeping and wailing escort
the coffin to its resting-place. For its burial we
buy a well-drained ground. In memory of our
deceased parent we build a shrine. For the
purpose of showing our remembrance we offer
sacrifices every spring and autumn.</p>

<p>“When our parents are alive, we should treat
them with love and respect. When they are dead,
we should have sorrow for them. By doing so
we shall have performed the duty of mankind,
and have done what ought to be done by a filial
son, and by the living to the dead.</p>

<h4><em>The Filial Piety that influenced Heaven</em></h4>

<p class="no-indent">Yü Shun, the son of Ku Sou, had an exceedingly
filial disposition; his father, however, was stupid,
his mother perverse, and his younger brother,
Hsiang, very conceited. His actions are related
in the <cite>Shang Shu</cite>, in the <cite>Chung Yung</cite>, and in the
works of Mencius. Those who speak of him say
that Shun cultivated the hills of Li (in the province
of Shansi), where he had elephants to plough his
fields and birds to weed the grain. So widespread
was the renown of his virtue that the
Emperor Yao heard of him, and sent his nine
sons to serve him, and gave to him two of his
daughters in marriage, and afterwards resigned
to him the imperial dignity.</p>

<p>Of all those whose virtue and filial duty deserve
to be illustrated, Shun is pre-eminent;
and his example, in obeying his parents, is worthy
of being handed down to posterity, through
myriads of ages. Once he was in great danger
in a well, into which he was commanded by his
father to descend, and his brother cast down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
stones upon him; again, he was in a granary, when
it was set on fire; but from these, as well as
from many other dangers, he escaped unhurt.
He fished, burned pottery, ploughed and sowed,
with great toil on the hills of Li. He laboriously
performed all these duties, but his parents were
not affected, while his brother Hsiang became
more insolent and overbearing. His parents
alleged crimes against him, but Shun could not
find that he had done wrong; he loved and
revered them, though they did not requite him
with affection. His feelings were grieved at
these manifold troubles, and with strong crying
and tears he invoked Heaven.</p>

<p>His perfect sincerity was effectual to renovate
his family; his parents became pleasant, and his
brother more conciliatory and virtuous. Heaven
also considered his excellency to be great, and
regarded him as truly good, thus establishing
his reputation so firmly that it was perpetuated
to, and influenced, succeeding ages. Even Confucius
is regarded as elevated but a little above
Shun, and I would praise and extol them both
to coming generations.</p>

<h4><em>Affection shown in tasting Soups and Medicines</em></h4>

<p>The Emperor Wên of the Han dynasty, the
third son of his father, Kao Tsu, was appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
Prince over the country of Tai. His own mother,
Po, was Queen-dowager, and Wên was constant
in his attendance on her. She was ill for three
years, during which time his eyelids did not close,
nor was the girdle of his dress unloosed; and
she took none of the soups and medicines prepared
for her till he had tasted them. This
benevolence and filial affection was heard of
throughout the empire.</p>

<p>Wên received direction to go and arrange the
imperial sacrifices, and requested his mother to
accompany him to the royal domains. Morning
and evening he visited her in her own apartments,
and handed her the fragrant dishes. If the
provisions had lost their flavour, he was vexed;
and when tasting the medicines he commanded
perfect silence. The live-long night his girdle was
not loosed, nor for three years were his eyelids
closed. By as much as his animal spirits were exhausted,
by so much the more did his heart become
fixed on the subject of its affection; and for a long
time his thoughts were not distracted. Such
filial love and virtue so moved upon Heaven’s
kind regard, that it wrought upon his father to
confer the throne upon him as his patrimony.</p>

<h4><em>Gnawing her Finger pained his Heart</em></h4>

<p>During the Chou dynasty there lived a lad named
Tsêng Ts‘an, a disciple of Confucius, who served<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
his mother very dutifully. Tsêng was in the
habit of going to the hills to collect faggots; and
once, while he was thus absent, many guests
came to his house, towards whom his mother was
at a loss to know how to act. She, while expecting
her son, who delayed his return, began
to gnaw her fingers. Tsêng suddenly felt a pain
in his heart, and took up his bundle of faggots
in order to return home; and when he saw his
mother, he kneeled and begged to know what
was the cause of her anxiety. She replied:
“There have been some guests here who came
from a great distance, and I bit my finger in order
to arouse you to return to me.”</p>

<p>The faculties of mind and body in both mother
and son sprang originally from the same source,
and are alike; but in common men this connection
is broken and interrupted, and they are
dull and stupid. Those sages whose nature is
heavenly differ from the rest of mankind; and
virtue, as in a breath, permeates their whole
souls. At a certain time, when Tsêng was absent
to collect faggots, visitors came and knocked at
his door in great haste; and as there was no
man at home ready to receive them, his mother
was much grieved. He had entered the dense
fog on the hills and did not know where he was,
when his mother leaned against the door-post
and gnawed her fingers as if she would go in
quest of him. Her son in the hills is suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
seized with a pain in his heart, and quickly takes
up his bundle of faggots to return; although
distant, he sympathises with his mother’s grief
and complaint. The hearts of mother and son
are mutually affected, one influencing the other,
in the same manner as the amber draws small
straws and the loadstone attracts the slender
needle. From the remotest period sages have
been able to control their dispositions, and in
the deepest silence have revolved their actions
as in a breath. The moving influence that such
minds have on each other the generality of men
cannot understand. The devotedness with which
they serve their parents and the respect with
which they cherish them—who can comprehend.</p>

<h4><em>Clad in a Single Garment, he was obedient
to his Mother</em></h4>

<p>During the Chou dynasty lived Min Sun, a
disciple of Confucius, who in early life lost his
mother. His father subsequently married another
wife, who bore him two children, but disliked
Sun. In winter she clothed him in garments
made of rushes, while her own children wore
cotton clothes. Min was employed in driving his
father’s chariot, and his body was so cold that
the reins dropped from his hands, for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
carelessness his father chastised him; yet he
did not vindicate himself. When his father
knew the circumstances, he determined to divorce
his second wife; but Sun said, “Whilst mother
remains, one son is cold; if mother departs, three
sons will be destitute.” The father desisted
from his purpose; and after this the mother was
led to repentance, and became a good and virtuous
parent.</p>

<p>The filial piety of the renowned Shun influenced
Heaven, whilst that of Min renovated mankind.
If Heaven be influenced, all below it will be
transformed; if men be renovated, from them
will spring a power able to cause their families
to become good. In all ages men have exhibited
a great love for their wives; but dutiful children
have often met with unkindness. Min carefully
concealed all his grievances, and refused to indulge
in any complaint; even while suffering severely
from cold and hunger, he maintained his affection
unabated. During the long period which he
endured this oppressive treatment, his good
disposition became manifest; and by his own
conduct he was able to maintain the harmony
of the family unimpaired. His father and mother
were influenced by his filial devotion; and his
brothers joined in extolling his virtues. All his
friends and acquaintances, with united voice,
celebrated his merits; and the men of his native
village joyfully combined to spread the fame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
of his actions. The memory of his agreeable
countenance and pleasing manners was perpetuated
to the remotest ages; and his example
was in many respects like that of Shun, whose
parents were equally perverse.</p>


<h3>No. V</h3>

<h4><em>He carried Rice for his Parents</em></h4>

<p>In the Chou dynasty lived Chung Yu, also a
disciple of Confucius, who, because his family was
poor, usually ate herbs and coarse pulse; and he
also went more than a hundred li to procure rice
for his parents. Afterwards, when they were
dead, he went south to the country of Ch‘u,
where he was made commander of a hundred
companies of chariots. There he became rich,
storing up grain in myriads of measures, reclining
upon cushions, and eating food served to him in
numerous dishes; but, sighing, he said: “Although
I should now desire to eat coarse herbs and bring
rice for my parents, it cannot be!”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said Chung Yu, “although I was a
scholar, yet my parents were poor; and how
was I to nourish them?” Exhausted he travelled
the long road and cheerfully brought rice for his
parents. Pleasantly he endured the toil, and
exerted his utmost strength without any commendation.
At that time his lot in life was hard
and unfortunate, and he little expected the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
official honours he afterwards enjoyed. But
when his parents were dead, and he had become
rich and honourable, enjoying all the luxuries
of life, then he was unhappy and discontented;
not cheerful as in the days of his poverty, nor
happy as when he ministered to his parents’
wants.</p>


<h3>No. VI</h3>

<h4><em>With Sports and Embroidered Robes he amused
his Parents</em></h4>

<p>In the Chou dynasty there flourished Lao Lai
Tzŭ, who was very obedient and reverent towards
his parents, manifesting his dutifulness by exerting
himself to provide them with every delicacy.
Although upwards of seventy years of age, he
declared that he was not yet too old, and, dressed
in gaudy-coloured garments, would frisk and cut
capers like a child in front of his parents. He
would also take up buckets of water and try to
carry them into the house; but, feigning to slip,
would fall to the ground, wailing and crying like
a child; and all these things he did in order to
divert his parents.</p>

<p>In the country of Ch‘u lived Lao Lai Tzŭ, who,
when so old that he had lost nearly all his teeth,
made every effort to rejoice and comfort his
parents, constantly endeavouring to gladden their
hearts. At times he imitated the playfulness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
a little child, and arraying himself in gaudy and
variegated clothes, amused them by his strutting
and gambols. He would likewise purposely fall
on the ground, kicking and wailing to the utmost
of his power. His mother was delighted, and
manifested her joy in her countenance. Thus did
Lai forget his age in order to rejoice the hearts of
his parents; and affection, harmony, and joy
prevailed among the family. If this ardent love
for his parents had been insincere and constrained,
how could it be referred to as worthy of imitation?</p>


<h3>No. VII</h3>

<h4><em>With Deer’s Milk he supplied his Parents</em></h4>

<p>In the time of the Chou dynasty lived Yen,
who possessed a very filial disposition. His father
and mother were aged, and both were afflicted
with sore eyes, to cure which they desired to
have some deer’s milk. Yen concealed himself
in the skin of a deer, and went deep into the
forests, among the herds of deer, to obtain some
of their milk for his parents. While amongst
the trees the hunters saw him, and were about
to shoot at him with their arrows, when Yen
disclosed to them his true character and related
the history of his family, with the reasons for his
conduct.</p>

<p>Do his parents desire some milk from the deer?
He is not deterred by the obstacles in the way of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
procuring it; but clothing himself in a hairy
garment, he goes carefully seeking for it among
the multitudes of wild beasts. He closely imitated
the cry, <em>yew, yew</em>, of the fawns, watching
for the tracks of the herds. By this mode he
obtained the sweet secretion; he also surprised
the hunters whom he met in the deep and lonely
forest.</p>


<h3>No. VIII</h3>

<h4><em>He sold himself to bury his Father</em></h4>

<p>During the Han dynasty lived Tung Yung,
whose family was so very poor that when his father
died, he was obliged to sell himself in order to
procure money to bury his remains. After this
he went to another place to gain the means of
redeeming himself; and on his way he met a
lady who desired to become his wife, and go with
him to his master’s house. She went with Tung,
and wove three hundred pieces of silk, which
being completed in two months, they returned
home; and on the way, having reached the shade
of the cassia-tree where they met before, the
lady bid him adieu and vanished from his sight.</p>

<p>Tung could not endure to behold his father’s
bones lying exposed, but had not sufficient means
to bury them. He saw that his household goods
were not sufficient, and he said: “This little body
of mine, what is the use of it? If I sell it, I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
redeem it again, and thus bury my father, who
will be saved from dishonour.” His filial piety
moved Heaven to direct a female spirit in human
form to come and help him in fulfilling his engagement;
she wove three hundred pieces of silk,
and thus procured the redemption of a man of
truly filial heart.</p>


<h3>No. IX</h3>

<h4><em>He hired himself out as a Labourer to support
his Mother</em></h4>

<p>In the time of the Han dynasty lived Chiang Ko,
who, when young, lost his father, and afterwards
lived alone with his mother. Times of trouble
arising, which caused them much distress, he
took his mother on his back, and fled. On the
way he many times met with companies of
robbers, who would have compelled him to go
with them and become a bandit, but Chiang
entreated them with tears to spare him, saying
that he had his aged mother with him; and the
robbers could not bear to kill him. Altering his
course, he came into the district of Hsia-p‘ei,
extremely impoverished and reduced, where he
hired himself out and supported his mother;
and such was his diligence that he was able to
supply her with whatever she personally required.</p>

<p>Passing over the hills and wading through
the streams, he carried his mother with much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
difficulty. It was during a year of famine, when
all the inhabitants of the land were in confusion
from the scarcity of food, and engagements were
frequent between the soldiers and the bandits,
and signal fires were lighted on the high hills.
Chiang was fearful lest the robbers should meet
him on the road and plunder him; and they did
seize him, regardless of his cries and tears, and
were about to rob him; but when they knew of
his filial piety and affection for his mother, they
permitted him to proceed. While journeying, he
was too poor to procure any food beyond the
bare necessaries of life; and because he could
not provide comforts and delicacies for his mother,
he was grieved as if it had been his fault. He
went and hired himself for labour; with the
greatest diligence he adhered to his purpose to
maintain his mother; and soon the stranger
obtained an abundance of food and clothing.
This success caused his mother to rejoice, and
they were both delighted, she forgetting her
former hardships in the joy that filled her breast.</p>


<h3>No. X</h3>

<h4><em>He fanned the Pillow and warmed the Bedclothes</em></h4>

<p>In the Han dynasty lived Huang Hsiang, who
when only nine years old lost his mother, whom
he loved so ardently and remembered so well
that all the villagers praised his filial duty. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
was employed in the severest toil, and served his
father with entire obedience. In summer, when
the weather was warm, he fanned and cooled his
father’s pillow and bed; and in winter, when it
was cold, he warmed the bed-clothes with his body.
The magistrate sent him an honorary banner, as
a mark of distinction.</p>

<p>When the heat of summer made it difficult to
sleep quietly, the lad knew what would be for
the comfort of his venerated parent. Taking a
fan, he slowly waved it about the silken curtains,
and the cool air, entering, enveloped and filled
the pillows and bed. In winter, when the snow
threatened to crush in the roof and the fierce
wind shook the fences, and the cold penetrated
to the bones, making it hazardous to unloose the
girdle, then Hsiang warmed his father’s bed that
he might not fear, because of the cold, to enter
the “place of dreams.”</p>


<h3>No. XI</h3>

<h4><em>The Gushing Fountain and the Frisking Carp</em></h4>

<p>In the Han dynasty lived Chiang Shih, who
served his mother with perfect obedience; and
his wife P‘ang also fulfilled her mother-in-law’s
commands without the least reluctance. The
old lady loved to drink of the water from the
river six or seven li away from her cottage, and
P‘ang used to go to draw it and hand it to her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
She was also fond of carp, and when it was
obtained, deeming herself unable to consume
alone what her children with great toil and trouble
continually prepared for her, usually invited some
of the neighbours to feast with her. By the side
of the cottage there suddenly gushed a fountain,
the taste of whose waters was like that of the
river, and it also produced two living fishes daily.
These were taken out and prepared by Chiang
Shih for his mother.</p>

<p>The fish from the river were fresh and delicious,
and the water was sweet; the mother of Chiang
Shih wished to taste of both daily. Her son went
to purchase the fish and her daughter-in-law to
bring the water; as constantly as the revolution
of morning and evening did they exert themselves
in this arduous labour. Having obtained the fish
and water, her countenance brightened, and,
laughing, she invited in one of the neighbours to
rejoice and partake of them with her. Sitting
opposite at the table, together they ate them, she
foolishly not even regarding, but totally forgetting,
her son and daughter, who with so much
trouble had prepared them for her. Heaven
took pity on these two filial children, and employed
its divine power to assist them, sending a
spirit to strike the earth with an axe which
caused a perennial spring to bubble forth. The
taste of the water from the fountain was like that
from the river, and two fish continually sported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
about in it, which henceforth Chiang Shih took
out for their sustenance, nor was there any fear
of the supply failing. To procure the fish now
no money was needed, to obtain the water no
long and weary walk was to be taken. It was as
if the productions of this river and of the water
were transferred into the midst of the cottage;
and Chiang Shih could support his family with
ease for many years.</p>

<h4><em>He carved Wood and served his Parents</em></h4>

<p>During the Han dynasty lived Ting Lan, whose
parents both died when he was young, before he
could obey and support them; and he reflected
that for all the trouble and anxiety he had caused
them, no recompense had yet been given. He
then carved wooden images of his parents, and
served them as if they had been alive. For a
long time his wife would not reverence them;
and one day, taking a bodkin, she pricked their
fingers in derision. Blood flowed immediately
from the wound; and seeing Ting coming, the
images wept. He inquired into the circumstances,
and forthwith divorced his wife.</p>

<p>He remembers his parents, but cannot see
them; so he carves wood to represent their
persons. He believes that their spirits are now
the same as when they were alive, and his quietless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
heart trusts that their spirits have entered the
carved images. He cannot rest until he has made
their statues, so strong is his desire to nourish and
reverence them. He now reveres them, although
dead, as if they were alive; and hopes they will
condescend to dwell in his ancestral hall.</p>


<h3>No. XIII</h3>

<h4><em>For his Mother’s Sake he would bury his Child</em></h4>

<p>In the days of the Han dynasty lived Kuo Chü,
who was very poor. He had one child three
years old; and such was his poverty that his
mother usually divided her portion of food with
this little one. Kuo says to his wife: “We are so
poor that our mother cannot be supported, for
the child divides with her the portion of food that
belongs to her. Why not bury this child?
Another child may be born to us, but a mother,
once gone, will never return.” His wife did not
venture to object to the proposal, and Kuo
immediately digs a hole about three cubits deep,
when suddenly he lights upon a pot of gold, and
on the metal reads the following inscription:
“Heaven bestows this treasure upon Kuo Chü,
the dutiful son; the magistrate may not seize
it, nor shall the neighbours take it from him.”</p>

<p>What a foolish action, that the sage Kuo should
be willing to bury his own child! Fearing lest
his mother should not have enough to eat, he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
willing to resign his child to death; but when it
is dead, what relief will there be for the grief of its
affectionate grandmother? When a number of
cares come at some future time, who then will be
able to disperse them if the child is dead? But
at this time the reflection that his mother would
be in want filled his breast with grief, and he had
no time to think of the future when he would be
childless. Heaven having given him a dutiful
mind, caused him to take a light hoe for digging
the earth. Together Kuo and his wife went,
sorrowing and distressed, by the way, until they
came to a very hilly place, where they stopped.
Having dug into the ground, suddenly a gleam
of light shot forth, and the pot of yellow gold
which Heaven had deposited there was seen.
Taking it up, they clasped their child with ecstasy
in their arms and returned home; for now they
had sufficient to support their whole family in
plenty.</p>

<h4><em>He seized the Tiger and saved his Father</em></h4>

<p>In the Han dynasty lived Yang Hsiang, a lad
of fourteen, who was in the habit of following his
father to the fields to cut grain. Once a tiger
seized his father, and was slowly carrying him off,
when Yang, anxious for his father and forgetting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
himself, although he had no iron weapon in his
hand, rushed forward and seized the tiger by the
neck. The beast let the prey fall from his teeth,
and fled, and Yang’s father was thus saved from
injury and death.</p>

<p>A tiger suddenly appears in the borders of the
field, and seizes the man as lightly as he catches
a sheep, and drags him off. Yang Hsiang, seeing
the sudden peril of his father, was vexed that he
had no weapon with an iron head; but being
strongly excited and his feelings roused, he ran
forward in the path, crying with a loud voice,
and grasped the tiger by the neck. The frightened
animal fled, nor stopped in its rapid course until
it reached the high hills. Yang then, in a gentle
manner, raised his father up and led him home,
endeavouring to soothe his mind and dispel his
fears, and also presented him the golden winecup.
Among the great number of sages whose
reputations are famous, how few of them have
been devoted and filial at the hazard of their
lives! But this lad, quite young and fair, as soon
as he saw his father’s danger, risked his own life;
surely his fame will spread throughout the
country. We have heard of the lady T‘i Ying,
who saved her father from banishment, and of
young Chu O, who lost her life in trying to rescue
her father from drowning; and I think that Yang
Hsiang will form a trio with them, and the three
be celebrated in the same ode.</p>

<h4><em>He collected Mulberries to support his Mother</em></h4>

<p>During the Han dynasty lived Ts‘ai Shun,
whose father died when he was young, and who
served his mother very dutifully. It happened
that, during the troubles of the time, when Wang
Mang was plotting to usurp the throne, there were
years of scarcity, in which he could not procure
food, and Ts‘ai was compelled to gather mulberries,
which he assorted, putting them into two
vessels. The red-eyebrowed robber<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> saw him,
and inquired why he did thus. Ts‘ai replied:
“The black and ripe berries I give to my mother,
the yellow and unripe ones I eat myself.” The
bandit admired his filial affection, and rewarded
him with three measures of white rice and the
leg of an ox.</p>

<p>Anxious and fearful, he seeks for food; untiring
in his toil, he takes up his baskets and penetrates
the thickets of the distant forests, where he
finds many mulberry-trees. His hunger now
has something to satisfy its cravings; he also
remembers his mother, and that he must carry
some to her. The ripe and unripe berries he
does not put together, but divides them, so that
mother and son can each have their proper
portion. The chieftain heard of his conduct, and
highly praised him, conferring a gift upon him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
and speaking of his filial piety to all around.
Taking up his rice and flesh, Ts‘ai returned home
to his mother with the food; and in their joy
they even forgot that the year was one of dearth.</p>

<h4><em>He laid up the Oranges for his Mother</em></h4>

<p>Lu Chi, a lad six years old, who lived in the time
of Han and in the district of Kinkiang, once met
the celebrated general Yüan Shu, who gave him
a few oranges. Two of them the lad put in his
bosom, and when turning to thank the giver, they
fell out on the ground. When the general saw
this, he said: “Why does my young friend, who
is now a guest, put the fruit away in his bosom?”
The youth, bowing, replied: “My mother is very
fond of oranges, and I wished, when I returned
home, to present them to her.” At this answer
Yüan was much astonished.</p>

<p>On account of his love for his parent, he would
not at first taste the present of fruit, but put into
his sleeve to carry home the fragrant and luscious
gift. I think that when he saw his mother, her
pleasant countenance must have brightened, for
the fruit filled his bosom and delighted all who
came near him. Lu, although so young, had the
true heavenly disposition; even in the small
matter of an orange he did not forget his parent’s
wishes. Many children are perhaps like this boy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
and those who requite their parents for the care
bestowed upon them, we hope, are not few.</p>


<h3>No. XVII</h3>

<h4><em>On hearing the Thunder he wept at the Tomb</em></h4>

<p>In the country of Wei lived Wang P‘ou, a very
dutiful child, whose mother, when alive, was much
afraid of thunder. After her death her grave
was dug in the hilly forest; and whenever it blew
and rained furiously, and Wang heard the sound
of the chariot of the Thunder-goddess rolling
along, he hastened immediately to the grave, and,
reverently kneeling, besought her with tears,
saying: “I am here, dear mother; do not be
alarmed.” And afterwards, whenever he read
in <cite>The Book of Odes</cite> this sentence, “Children
should have deep and ardent affection for their
parents, who have endured so much anxiety in
nourishing them,” the tears flowed abundantly at
the recollection of his mother.</p>

<p>Suddenly the black clouds arise from the
wilderness, whirled by the wind; he hears the
distant mutter of thunder from the southern hills.
Heedless of the rain, hastily he speeds over the
rugged path leading to the tomb, and as he goes
round the grave his tones of grief and entreaty
are heard. The roaring of the dreadful thunder
affrights the ears of men, one clap following
another in quick succession. If his kind mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
when alive, always dreaded the voice of Heaven’s
majesty, how much more will she now, when lying
alone in the depths of the wild forest! If P‘ou
was with his mother, he knew she would be comforted;
and he thinks that if in the green hills she
has a companion, she will not be terrified. Afterwards,
being successful, he refused to take the
duties of an officer under the Emperor Ssŭ-ma,
because he wished to go frequently to visit the
grave of his parent. And when he was going and
returning from it, he would weep at the recollection
of his mother, and ask himself: “If I have
not yet recompensed the care and trouble my
mother endured for me, what more can I do?”
And to this day, whenever scholars read the pages
of the <cite>Liu O</cite>, they remember how tears bedewed
the cheeks of Wang P‘ou.</p>

<h4><em>He wept to the Bamboos, and Shoots sprang up</em></h4>

<p>Mêng Tsung, who lived in the Chin dynasty,
lost his father when young. His mother was very
ill, and one winter’s day she longed to taste a
soup made of bamboo shoots, but Mêng could not
procure any. At last he went into the bamboo
grove, and, clasping the bamboos with his hands,
wept bitterly. His filial love moved Nature, and
the ground slowly opened, sending forth several
shoots, which he gathered and carried home. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
made a soup of them, which his mother tasted,
and immediately recovered from her malady.</p>

<p>In winter, when the forests are unsightly and
bare, and the bamboos sombre and gloomy, for
plants to send forth their branches is surprising
and unexpected. But it is impossible to root out
the true filial nature from men who have it,
although senseless and ignorant people, not understanding
its power, ridicule them, calling them
mad. The young Mêng Tsung dutifully served
his mother, and morning and evening waited on
her to receive her commands. His mother was
ill, and desired the delicacy of a soup made from
bamboo shoots; but in dreary winter, Nature
still concealed her fruits awaited. With anxious
haste he goes to the cheerless forest, which he
enters, seeking for them; but not finding the
shoots, he entreats the bamboos with tears. One
petition from his inmost heart ascended to the
threshold of heaven, and the deities were delighted,
laughing with pleasure. A miracle is
wrought, the ordinary course of nature is reversed,
and suddenly the pearly shoots appear
in the forest.</p>

<h4><em>He slept on Ice to procure Carp</em></h4>

<p>During the Chin dynasty lived Wang Hsiang,
who early lost his mother, and whose stepmother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
Chu had no affection for him. His father also,
hearing many evil reports against him, in course
of time ceased to regard him with kindness. His
mother was in the habit of eating fresh fish at her
meals, but winter coming, the ice bound up the
rivers. Wang unloosed his clothes, and went to
sleep on the ice in order to seek them; when
suddenly the ice opened of itself, and two carp
leapt out, which he took up and carried to his
mother. The villagers, hearing of the affair, were
surprised, and admired one whose filial duty was
the cause of such an unusual event.</p>

<p>The river is firmly bound up by ice, and the
fish are hidden in their deep retreats. Perturbed
and anxious, Wang goes out to seek the fish,
apparently forgetting that it was winter. His
resolution is fixed, and although it is at the risk
of his life, he will go. He was not dismayed at
the coldness of the snow, nor terrified at the
fierceness of the winds. Even the wicked spirits
were deterred from injuring him, and dared not
molest him. If metals and stones can be opened,
shall ice be considered too difficult to cleave?
The frisking fish came up on the surface of the
water, obedient to the hand of him who would
take them out. A thousand ages cannot efface
the remembrance of the crack in the ice, nor
obliterate the fragrant traces of so worthy a
deed.</p>

<h4><em>Wu Mêng fed the Mosquitoes</em></h4>

<p>Wu Mêng, a lad eight years of age, who lived
in the Chin dynasty, was very dutiful to his
parents. They were so poor that they could
not afford to furnish their beds with mosquito-curtains;
and every summer night myriads of
mosquitoes attacked them without restraint,
feasting upon their flesh and blood. Although
there were so many, yet Wu would not drive
them away from himself, lest they should go to
his parents and annoy them. Such was his filial
affection!</p>

<p>The buzzing of the mosquitoes sounds like
<em>ying, ying</em>, and their united hum is almost equal
to thunder. His tired parents are reclining on
their bed, their countenances already sunk in
slumber. Legions of mosquitoes fiercely attack
them, alternately retreating and advancing. The
insects disturb the dreaming sleepers, and with
annoyance they toss from side to side. Wu sees
them sucking his parents’ blood, which causes
his heart to grieve; his flesh, he thinks, can be
easily pierced, but that of his parents is hard to
penetrate. Lying on the bed, he threw off his
clothes, and soon feeling the pain of their attacks,
he cried: “I have no dread of you, nor have
you any reason to fear me; although I have a
fan, I will not use it, nor will I strike you with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
my hand. I will lie very quietly, and let you
gorge to the full.”</p>

<h4><em>He resigned Office to seek his Mother</em></h4>

<p>In the Sung dynasty lived Chu Shou-ch‘ang,
whose mother, Liu, when he was seven years of
age, left the family because she was hated by his
father’s wife; and mother and son did not see
each other for about fifty years. It was during
the reign of Shên Tsung that Chu resigned his
official station and went into the Ch‘in country,
and there made an engagement with his family
“that he would not return until he had found his
mother.” He then travelled into T‘ung-chou,
where he discovered his mother, who at that time
was over seventy years of age.</p>

<p>Thus Chu exclaimed: “I have a mother; but,
alas! separated, we abide in different villages.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
It was not the free will of my mother which led
her thus to forsake her son, but the envious
mistress who compelled her to go. Without a
mother, on whom shall I rely? to whom shall I
pour out my sorrows and cares? Now I am
grown older and have become an officer, but as
yet I have been unable to return the kindness
of my parent. In what place, among all the
countries under heaven, does she live? I am
determined to resign my office and seek her abode,
not deterred from the trouble of the search. To
effect it, I will part from my family and no longer
be a companion with them; I will not return till
I find my mother, and they need not await in
expectation of me.” Heaven directed his way,
and he came into T‘ung-chou, where she resided.
When the mother and the son met each other, joy
and grief arose together—joy for the meeting
after fifty years, sorrow that they had been so
long apart. But now, in one hour, all their long-accumulated
griefs were laid aside, and joy and
gladness filled their hearts. Chu possesses the
true heavenly disposition, and honours and
riches cannot destroy his affection for his mother.</p>


<h3>No. XXIV</h3>

<h4><em>He watched by his Mother’s Bedside</em></h4>

<p>In the Yüan-yu period of the Sung dynasty,
Huang T‘ing-chien filled the office of prefect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
He was of a very filial disposition, and although
honourable and renowned, yet he received his
mother’s commands with the utmost deference.
When his mother was seized with illness, he
watched her for a whole year without leaving
her bedside or even taking off his clothes; and
at her death he mourned so bitterly that he himself
fell ill and nearly lost his life.</p>

<p>Well-written poetry flows along like rills
meandering among the hills and valleys. This
instance of a dutiful heart has not as yet been
brought into much notice. For a whole year
he tended his parent in her illness; and both she
who dwelt in the curtained room (<em>i.e.</em> his mother)
and he who remained in the hall (<em>i.e.</em> his father)
strove to express the merits of their son. It
would be difficult to find another child who would
have done so—all would be dilatory and unwilling;
and where shall we meet another who
would undergo such drudgery himself with keenness
and pleasure? Although raised to high
office, he does not hesitate to perform the most
troublesome and minute duties, for he loves his
parents; how then can we suppose that he will
change from what he was when young and
unhonoured?</p>
